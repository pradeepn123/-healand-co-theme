A good example is Supergoop (<a href=\"https:\/\/supergoop.com\" title=\"https:\/\/supergoop.com\">https:\/\/supergoop.com<\/a>). It has a lot of brightly coloured images and text but still looks very neat and clean. The brand colours are throughout the home page and they organize the page well. Farmacy Beauty (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.farmacybeauty.com\" title=\"https:\/\/www.farmacybeauty.com\">https:\/\/www.farmacybeauty.com<\/a>) also has a similar layout to Supergoop. <br\/>- Navigation for shopping products by ingredient and by benefit, similar to Moonjuice and Organika. Garden of Life and Genuine Health also have great organization of their products. <br\/><br\/>Education Section:<br\/>- An Ingredients page inspired by Moonjuice, Ritual, Origins, and Seed, providing a scientific and informative approach to ingredient information. Inspiration for landing page with all of the ingredients is Moonjuice, Ritual and Origins. For the individual ingredient pages themselves, use Function of Beauty as an example for the layout. <br\/>- A Learn tab featuring a dropdown menu with access to ingredient information landing page and blog landing page.<br\/>- Blog should be organized based on categories (will provide categorization). Use Sproos as an example for the layout\/organization of the blog.<br\/><br\/>Shop All Page:<br\/>- Care\/of-style shop all page with product images that change to benefits written out in text upon hovering.<br\/>- Division of the shop all pages by benefit or ingredient for easier navigation.<br\/><br\/>Product Pages:<br\/>- Comprehensive information sections include description, benefits, how to use, ingredients, and sourcing, as shown in Moonjuice and Ritual.<br\/>- Ingredients section using ingredient images and linking to the ingredient info page.<br\/>- Icons for main callouts (e.g., vegan, 3rd party tested), ingredient highlights, and user-friendly presentation with images\/icons.<br\/>- The product page will be branded based on product colors inspired by Goli. <br\/><br\/>Blog Page:<br\/>- Organized and categorized blog posts. <br\/>- A good example is Function of Beauty (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.functionofbeauty.com\/blog\" title=\"https:\/\/www.functionofbeauty.com\/blog\">https:\/\/www.functionofbeauty.com\/blog<\/a>). Don't love how they've categorized the posts but the boxes with the image and title of the blog posts is nice and the page as a whole is easy to follow and read. Supergoop also has a good layout (<a href=\"https:\/\/thebrightside.supergoop.com\" title=\"https:\/\/thebrightside.supergoop.com\">https:\/\/thebrightside.supergoop.com<\/a>). They have a featured blog post at the top followed by other more recent posts. Once we have more posts, the highlight reel but with blog posts could be something good to add with blog posts that are frequently visited.<br\/>- Add to cart function directly from the blog page.<br\/>- Having a related articles or you might also like this with links to other similar posts. <br\/><br\/>Additional Pages:<br\/>- Revamped About Us, FAQ, Shipping\/Returns, and Privacy Policy pages.<br\/>- A general FAQ page and FAQ sections are integrated into the ingredients info pages.<br\/>- Landing page for loyalty program information. <br\/><br\/>Design and Integrations:<br\/>- Incorporate your colorful branding and packaging throughout the website.<br\/>- Migrate from Mailchimp to Klaviyo for email marketing.<br\/>- Set up a loyalty program and a subscription program. (Smile or Stamped - will be decided based on loyalty program type & conditions, Recharge for subscriptions)<br\/>- Include testimonial videos and user-generated content similar to Spoiledchild and Moonjuice. (foursixty.com\/videowise) <br\/>- Set up chat function via Gorgias. <br\/>- Where to find us in stores navigation (on the bottom of the page).<\/p>",

We use both extracts and raw ingredients to ensure that maximum dosage in the smallest form. Our products are more effective, thus requiring fewer doses. For example, one 500 mg capsule of our 5:1 ashwagandha extract is equivalent to 5 500 mg capsules of standard ashwagandha from other brands. This is because we extract the bioactive components of the plants and use those compounds in our products instead of all of the raw material. <br\/><br\/>Allergen-free: Our products are manufactured without the addition of most common allergens including gluten, dairy and soy. All products are plant-based and vegan friendly. Note - we are working on getting an official vegan certification for our products. <br\/><br\/>Unique packaging: Our packaging was designed to be approachable to people who are not familiar with supplements. Instead of creating packaging that was extremely medicinal, we created something a lot more approachable and friendly. <\/p>",
