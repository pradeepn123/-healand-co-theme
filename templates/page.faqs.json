Instead of all of the headings that are used in the example, could we have ABOUT, KEY BENEFITS, FOUND IN.<br\/><br\/>- Origins <a href=\"https:\/\/www.origins.ca\/ingredient-gallery\/vitamin-c\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.origins.ca\/ingredient-gallery\/vitamin-c\">(https:\/\/www.origins.ca\/ingredient-gallery\/vitamin-c)<\/a>: Similar to Function of Beauty but a bit busier in terms of text\/images. <br\/><br\/>- Joya (https:\/\/www.thejoyalife.com\/en-ca\/blogs\/wellness-lifestyle\/top-health-benefits-of-astragalus, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thejoyalife.com\/en-ca\/collections\/ingredient-intel):\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.thejoyalife.com\/en-ca\/collections\/ingredient-intel):\">https:\/\/www.thejoyalife.com\/en-ca\/collections\/ingredient-intel):<\/a> This one is a lot more text heavy, but still has the callouts at the top that give the reader an overview of the ingredient. <br\/><br\/>- Herbaland <a href=\"https:\/\/www.herbaland.ca\/pages\/vitamins\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.herbaland.ca\/pages\/vitamins\">(https:\/\/www.herbaland.ca\/pages\/vitamins)<\/a>: This one has a good amount of text for each product.

We use both extracts and raw ingredients to ensure that maximum dosage in the smallest form. Our products are more effective, thus requiring fewer doses. For example, one 500 mg capsule of our 5:1 ashwagandha extract is equivalent to 5 500 mg capsules of standard ashwagandha from other brands. This is because we extract the bioactive components of the plants and use those compounds in our products instead of all of the raw material. <br\/><br\/>Allergen-free: Our products are manufactured without the addition of most common allergens including gluten, dairy and soy. All products are plant-based and vegan friendly. Note - we are working on getting an official vegan certification for our products. <br\/><br\/>Unique packaging: Our packaging was designed to be approachable to people who are not familiar with supplements. Instead of creating packaging that was extremely medicinal, we created something a lot more approachable and friendly. <\/p>",
